<h2>card count= 23</h2>
<p><br>
	I ran four test trials for each group of index cards, the first test being my own results, and the other three those of my peers.  I chose to do this with participants of my own generation as their site-literacy and familiarity is more than that of many older people that I know. <br><br>
	The results from the card sorting of my own web site were quite contradictory to those of the NASA sort.  When sorting my cards, the particpants on average chose 7 Navigation categories, with a range of 4-9.  It seems that people prefered to have more specific navigation options, having each page containing significantly less content.</p>
