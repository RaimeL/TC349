<h2>card count= 23</h2>
<p><br>The results from the card sorting of my own web site were quite contradictory to those of the NASA sort.  When sorting my cards, the particpants on average chose 7 Navigation categories, with a range of 4-9.  It seems that people prefered to have more specific navigation options, having each page containing significantly less content.</p>
