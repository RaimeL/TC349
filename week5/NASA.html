I found that to begin with less Navigation Options, that included more content on each of the pages is the most successful, and most comprehensible for the majority people with this particular content. I also found myself drawn towards a less overwhelming collection of options for navigation.  There was a mean of 5 navigation options, with the range from 4-7. “Home” graced the navi of each participant, some variant of “News” and “Moon Facts” also appeared in each grouping.
